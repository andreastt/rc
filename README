ato's dotfiles.

So you've lost your way on the internet and accidentally come across
my dotfiles?  Don't panic.

These configuration files, so called “dotfiles”, have been collected,
massaged and accumulated over many years.  They are set up in such
a way that I can easily check out this repository on a new machine
and get started using it in a comfortable way relatively quickly.

They are shared publically so that others may take inspiration.  Do
note that they are, and always will be, a work-in-progress however,
as I continously strive to improve my workflow.

One day I will write something to document their use.  That day is
not now.

I set them up like this when I'm on a new machine:

    mkdir dev
    cd dev
    git clone https://github.com/andreastt/dotfiles.git
    cd

I then symlink the files I need on the current system:

    ln -s ~/dev/dotfiles/SRC DEST

Feel free to reuse any part and let them serve as inspiration.
