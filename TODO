- Combine various tabbing program, which would entail deducing
   the tabbing style (tab/2 spaces/4 spaces) from the input file
   - Possible alternatives are: predefine it (.go = tab, .js = 2, .py = 4,
      etc.) or to write an algorithm to guess it with sensible fallbacks
      for each language (e.g. a new file) based on file ending
      - Need for reading the AST, or can we make cruder
        assumptions?
